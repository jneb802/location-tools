**An updated UnityEditor based on Balrond's Location Tools.**

Location Tools facilitates the creation of Valheim Locations by including .blueprint or .vbuild files created with Valheim mods and importing the associated prefabs.  Objects referenced in the text files must already be in your unity project.

Install via Unity's Package Manager by pasting `https://github.com/probablykory/location-tools.git`.
